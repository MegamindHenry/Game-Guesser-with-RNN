But in the shadows, another force was awakening and getting ready to pour rivers of any blood in the name of their Dark Gods. The entities from the Warp craved for sacrifice and destruction: Abaddon, Warmaster of Chaos, was not one to refuse them their tribute. Orks, Eldar, Space Marines: whoever was willing to be the primary material of the satisfaction of the Ruinous Powers didn\u2019t really matter: Chaos had to prevail. And Abaddon spoke to his legions, and there was War. <br><br>Abaddon has decided to bring hostilities to a new level of bloodshed and Chaos is about to devore hosts of people.

Lovecraft wrote his classic tale of alien horror, \u201cThe Whisperer in Darkness.\u201d Lovecraft is now considered one of America\u2019s foremost writers of horror fiction, standing alongside the likes of Stephen King and Edgar Allan Poe. His story, which blends horror and science fiction, relates the adventure of Albert Wilmarth, a folklore professor at Miskatonic University, as he investigates legends of strange creatures rumored to dwell in the most remote mountains of Vermont. Wilmarth\u2019s investigation leads him to a discovery of horrors quite beyond anything he ever imagined, and ends in a desperate attempt to escape the remote New England hills with his life and sanity intact.\r\n\r\nThe H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society adapted Lovecraft\u2019s story as a feature-length motion picture, shooting it in the style of the classic horror films of the early \u201830s such as Dracula, King Kong and Frankenstein. As with their previous silent movie adaptation of Lovecraft\u2019s The Call of Cthulhu, the HPLHS used their MythoscopeTM technique to evoke the look and feel of early cinema. This production shot on location in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts to authentically capture the actual locations depicted in the story. A cast of Los Angeles actors, including Matt Foyer and Barry Lynch, bring the sweeping period tale to dramatic life. The result is a motion picture (a talkie, no less) that expands Lovecraft\u2019s short story into the kind of thrilling cinematic experience that Lovecraft himself might have enjoyed in 1931.",

Through voice-over narratives and frightened faces, &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; conveys a sense of human sanity being unraveled by too much forbidden fruit. By film's end, Foyer has the Thousand Yard Stare down to a science. His once-doubting Wilmarth has picked from the Tree of Knowledge, and become a reluctant believer.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://filmthreat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Film Threat</a><br><br>\u201cYou are about to encounter what very well be the single most successful H.P. Lovecraft adaptation ever to lick fear across a screen. Shot with an aesthetic, production design and performance style angled to emulate the feel of '30s/'40s Universal horror film - without falling into camp - WHISPERER arrives like shadows out of time, a discovered relic from another dimension. A genuinely scary film and a hellishly great time.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Bloody Disgusting</a><br><br>\u201cThe Whisperer in Darkness is a hell of a fine film, one of the best adaptations of a Lovecraft story ever made, and it's far superior to the vast majority of bigger-budgeted films that have &quot;H.P. Lovecraft's&quot; before their titles. Whisperer is faithful to a fault to the source material. What changes it does make a very welcome and actually enhance the story, as opposed to just padding things out, like so many other movies based on Lovecraft's short stories do. It is an obvious labour of love and, when movie makers care this much, it shows in every frame of the film. If you're a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, then this is MANDATORY VIEWING. If you've never read anything by HPL and always wanted to see what all the hoopla was about, this is a great place to start to get a handle on his unique and genre-changing brand of horror.\u201d<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.innsmouthfreepress.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Innsmouth Free Press</a><br>",

Really loud death metal. But I had always been interested in electronic music as well and started to make it. I will have some music and it will inspire me to make something visual. It\u2019s all very integrated because the music inspires the visuals but the visuals also inspire the music. It\u2019s a constant interaction between the two. I like to go into the details. I can work for a year on a small piece but I make it exactly how I want. VR is a really intense and immersive way to experience music. The best way I can describe Apex is like when I was fifteen and went to a death metal concert, and what I felt being in the crowd as the band played, the aggression and the energy. It\u2019s overwhelming and kind of scary but it makes you feel something. And that\u2019s what I wanted to do with Apex. There is destruction but there is also beauty in what you are seeing. It\u2019s really more of an atmosphere than a traditional story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith VR it\u2019s really hard to tell a story in the traditional sense. You visualize it in your mind in the traditional way, different shots, controlling the frame. But in VR when a character walks away they are still in the world, so you have to think about it in a much different way than films. So something like Apex is more of a pure atmosphere. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in doing now, putting people in worlds more than telling traditional stories in those worlds. I like it when people take off the headset and have to adjust to the earth again.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Arjan van Meerten, Creator",

It\u2019s really more of an atmosphere than a traditional story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith VR it\u2019s really hard to tell a story in the traditional sense. You visualize it in your mind in the traditional way, different shots, controlling the frame. But in VR when a character walks away they are still in the world, so you have to think about it in a much different way than films. So something like Apex is more of a pure atmosphere. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in doing now, putting people in worlds more than telling traditional stories in those worlds. I like it when people take off the headset and have to adjust to the earth again.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Arjan van Meerten, Creator",

We have striven to incorporate into the game the rich Chinese culture present in the rural areas. In our game, you can save the girls from their parent's feudal mindset by clicking on your mouse!<br><br>STORY:<br><br>The story centres around the protagonist Jiajun Lin, a high school student. Upon request from his father, who wants to buy the village school, he moves to Tangxia village to scout out the school's culture.

We don't guide you through a world on rails, and as a result, there are many hidden secrets awaiting discovery. Project: Gorgon also features an ambitious skill-based leveling system that bucks the current trend of pre-determined classes, allowing the player to combine skills in order to create a truly unique playing experience.<br><br><u><strong>AN IMMERSIVE WORLD</strong></u><br><br>When you play Project: Gorgon, we want you to feel as if you\u2019re immersed in a whole new virtual world. Rather than trying to manage this with just graphics and excessive backstory, we\u2019ve designed the game with dozens of gameplay features that make you feel like you\u2019re really there interacting with the world, such as: <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Each non-player (NPC) you meet has their own goals and interest, and reward players that choose to be their friend.<br></li><li>You can drop items on the ground, and other players can pick them up. What\u2019s so great about that? Imagine laying down a trail of literal (virtual) breadcrumbs to guide your friends (or lure your enemies) into the woods. <br></li><li>Shopkeepers keep inventory, so you can buy items that other players have sold to them. Want to help out new players? Sell your cast-off items to the shopkeeper in the new player zone and watch the new players go to town.<br></li><li>If you are on fire, you can jump into a lake to put it out. This type of mechanic can have a subtle effect on your strategies, especially when you are fighting a fire mage! <br></li><li>You can inscribe messages onto items, write books, and even leave notes for other players. Make your name as an in-game poet, or pronounce your greatness to the world!</li></ul><br><u><strong>UNIQUE EXPERIENCES</strong></u><br><br>In Project: Gorgon you kill monsters - a lot of them - and you take their loot. In order to keep the experience fun and interesting, we\u2019ve developed unique combat experiences to keep the fights feeling fresh. The loot is randomly generated, monsters have unique abilities, and dungeons have puzzles, traps, and terrifying bosses! The combat skills are entirely free-form. You can learn as many combat skills as you want, and use any two of them at the same time to create your own personal \u201cclass.\u201d Project: Gorgon features dozens to choose from, including: <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Battle Chemistry: Create huge explosions, inject yourself with mysterious mutagens or program a pet golem! <br></li><li>Unarmed Combat: Grapple and control enemies using a situational-aware combo system that varies based on where you are and what day it is. <br></li><li>Animal Handling: Tame animals and train them to become ferocious fighters. Then breed your best and sell their offspring to other players.<br></li><li>Necromancy: Seek out corpses and graveyards to raise an undead army. No graveyard around? Well, there are always the corpses of your friends. <br></li><li>Cow: Got turned into a cow by that boss? That sucks. But learn some kicks and how to stampede, and you'll be right back out there kicking grass in no time! <br></li><li>That\u2019s just a few! There\u2019s also Sword Fighting, Combat Psychology, Staff Fighting, Sigil Scripting, Mentalism, and more.</li></ul><br>Player Choices are important in Project: Gorgon. You can learn as many skills as you want, but sometimes power comes with downsides. You can become infected with lycanthropy and gain access to very powerful skill sets. As a lycanthrope, you are able to roam the world in a pack or as a lone wolf; however, when there is a full moon (which is tied to the real world lunar calendar) you are stuck in your beast form. There\u2019s no cure for lycanthropy.<br><br>You can become a Druid - which will give you great power, but you have to vow to drop everything when there\u2019s an emergency involving nature. It could be a forest fire, a monster invasion or even a pesky insect. Nature never lets you ignore your duties, ever. <br><br>New opportunists come open, but others will be closed. Can you bear heavy burdens in exchange for greater power?<br><br><u><strong>JOIN THE COMMUNITY</strong></u><br><br>The community is a critical aspect of Project: Gorgon.

In the dungeon, there are always 6 basic interactions (3 positive and 3 negative), followed by two special interactions. Your audience activates the functions by typing the commands in the chat window, for example <i>+heal</i>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Basic Interactions</strong></h2>Each basic interaction is associated with an activation chance percentage, shown after the name in parenthesis. This is the chance that a viewer\u2019s command will actually work. It falls when too many people trigger the corresponding action and it rises when it sits idle. If too many people trigger the action and it drops to 0% chance, it will go on a cooldown.<br><br><br><strong>Positive:</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+heal</i> \u2013 drops health or mana globes near player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+hit</i> \u2013 deal damage to random monster near player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+drop</i> \u2013 spawn a random drop near player (gold, card charge, etc.)<br><br><strong>Negative:</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-spawn</i> \u2013 spawn a random monster near player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-card</i> \u2013 apply a negative effect to player\u2019s card (knock, web, etc.)<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-steal</i> \u2013 destroy one of the visible drops at random<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Special Interactions</strong></h2><br>The special interactions are more powerful and they behave a bit differently.

After you install the DLC, a new button appears in the lower right corner of the character selection screen. It opens the <strong>Dungeons &amp; Streamers</strong> connection and configuration window.<br><br>Set up your connection with either Twitch or Mixer on the left side, by entering the name of your channel and requesting an OAuth token (Twitch) or by logging into Mixer in the external browser. For Twitch mode you can also limit the interactions to your paid channel subscribers. <br><br>On the right side, you can tweak the integration options. Hover on the checkbox labels for an explanation of each feature.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Viewer Influence Option</strong></h2><br>The Viewer Influence slider allows you to adjust the extent to which your audience can affect your game. Making it lower will make your game more balanced, but your audience will have fewer opportunities to spawn threats or aids. If you set it to High you will be totally at the mercy of your viewers and their actions will decide the difficulty level of the game. <br><br><i><strong>Note:</strong> viewer influence also automatically scales with the number of viewers active in the channel, so having more active viewers should NOT make the game any less balanced. </i>",

Try your luck and see if you can outsmart them in the paper dungeons!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/rarestone.png?t=1544460049\" > Allow your <strong>Twitch</strong> or <strong>Mixer</strong> audience to interact with your game<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/rarestone.png?t=1544460049\" > Enable or disable select features<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/rarestone.png?t=1544460049\" > Control audience influence strength <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/rarestone.png?t=1544460049\" > Limit the interactions to paid subscribers (Twitch)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Types of Interactions</strong></h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/ui.gif?t=1544460049\" ><br><br>When in game, the bar at the bottom of the screen always shows the commands available to your audience. In the dungeon, there are always 6 basic interactions (3 positive and 3 negative), followed by two special interactions. Your audience activates the functions by typing the commands in the chat window, for example <i>+heal</i>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Basic Interactions</strong></h2>Each basic interaction is associated with an activation chance percentage, shown after the name in parenthesis. This is the chance that a viewer\u2019s command will actually work. It falls when too many people trigger the corresponding action and it rises when it sits idle. If too many people trigger the action and it drops to 0% chance, it will go on a cooldown.<br><br><br><strong>Positive:</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+heal</i> \u2013 drops health or mana globes near player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+hit</i> \u2013 deal damage to random monster near player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+drop</i> \u2013 spawn a random drop near player (gold, card charge, etc.)<br><br><strong>Negative:</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-spawn</i> \u2013 spawn a random monster near player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-card</i> \u2013 apply a negative effect to player\u2019s card (knock, web, etc.)<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-steal</i> \u2013 destroy one of the visible drops at random<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Special Interactions</strong></h2><br>The special interactions are more powerful and they behave a bit differently. They start on cooldown and once available they can be triggered only once, or they are active for a specified amount of time. After this, they are replaced with another random special action. <br><br><strong>Positive:</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+prize</i> \u2013 drop a random prize for the player <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+throw</i> \u2013 when active, viewers can type <i>+throw</i> to throw random monsters away from player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+godmode</i> \u2013 give the player a short divine shield<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+stun</i> \u2013 when active, viewers can type <i>+stun</i> to stun monsters<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+deathrage</i> \u2013 trigger player\u2019s deathrage effect<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/paperheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>+freeze</i> \u2013 when active, viewers can type <i>+freeze</i> to freeze random monsters<br><br><strong>Negative:</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-stun</i> \u2013 stun the player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-poison</i> \u2013 poison player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-boss</i> \u2013 spawn a random boss near player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-freeze</i> \u2013 freeze player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-burn</i> \u2013 spawn fire under player<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-icetrap</i> \u2013 surround player with icicles<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-mouse</i> \u2013 when active, viewers can type <i>-mouse</i> to knock players mouse cursor<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/poisonheart.png?t=1544460049\" > <i>-throw</i> \u2013 when active, viewers can type <i>-throw</i> to throw random monsters towards player<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Legendary Card Voting</strong></h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/voting.gif?t=1544460049\" ><br><br>When you find a magic card, you will need to bring it to the Sage for identification. When this is a Legendary card (the most rare type of cards) you will be presented with two different cards for your audience to choose. During the vote, your viewers must type <i>+vote1</i> or <i>+vote2</i>. Everyone is entitled to one vote. If there is a tie, the card is selected at random. <br><br>In the options, you can disable this feature or set the length of the vote (default 30 sec).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>How to connect</strong></h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/968890/extras/twitchconnect.gif?t=1544460049\" ><br><br>Before you can start playing with your audience, you need to connect <strong>Book of Demons</strong> to your Twitch or Mixer account. After you install the DLC, a new button appears in the lower right corner of the character selection screen. It opens the <strong>Dungeons &amp; Streamers</strong> connection and configuration window.<br><br>Set up your connection with either Twitch or Mixer on the left side, by entering the name of your channel and requesting an OAuth token (Twitch) or by logging into Mixer in the external browser. For Twitch mode you can also limit the interactions to your paid channel subscribers. <br><br>On the right side, you can tweak the integration options. Hover on the checkbox labels for an explanation of each feature.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Viewer Influence Option</strong></h2><br>The Viewer Influence slider allows you to adjust the extent to which your audience can affect your game. Making it lower will make your game more balanced, but your audience will have fewer opportunities to spawn threats or aids. If you set it to High you will be totally at the mercy of your viewers and their actions will decide the difficulty level of the game. <br><br><i><strong>Note:</strong> viewer influence also automatically scales with the number of viewers active in the channel, so having more active viewers should NOT make the game any less balanced. </i>",

Upon further investigation, the PCs find that the entire garrison has been slaughtered to a man and the fort has been turned into a charnel house. Furthermore, the bodies of the barbarian besiegers and those of the slain Corovossan solders all bear ghastly chest-wounds and have had their hearts cut out and removed. Who or what caused these terrible mutilations? And why is the silent, lifeless garrison\u2019s main gate barred from within? What terrors may arise when the fires of courage turn to hate and the battlements run red with Hero's Blood?</i><br><br>Hero's Blood is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 4 to 6 10th-level characters. It can be run as a standalone wilderness adventure or tied into an ongoing campaign dealing with warfare or clashes between a corrupt colonial city and the tribes of the hinterlands and is an ideal complement to the official \u201cRed Queen Adventure Path,\u201d easily connecting to the fourth adventure in that series. This adventure deals with the theme of corruption of the mind, body, and soul, using the corruption rules presented in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Horror Adventures, to bring an extra element of terror to PCs as they uncover acts of carnage and cruelty that are even more sinister than they appear.

From miserly hoard-keepers to titanic warlords and engines of destruction, dragons epitomize all that a mythic monster would ever want to be. Here you will find chromatic dragons of terrifying size and surpassing lethality, from the juvenile blue and adult green to the ancient black, great wyrm white, and great wyrm red! The dragons' lesser kin, the drakes, are also featured, including the flame drake, forest drake, frost drake, and sea drake! Being just a little less deadly than a true dragon is hardly an indictment on their fearsome ferocity, of course, and each brings a set of unique and special talents to the battlefield, including the brand-new mythic monster, the carrion-craving fell drake, ally and steed to undead warlords that rule benighted badlands and ruined kingdoms of death. The product is rounded out by some special members of the extended dragon family, including ranging from the colossal pyroclastic terror that is the tor linnorm to the tiny but studious pseudodragon, friend to mages and loremasters everywhere, and the half-breed dracolisk, spawned from the unholy union of a depraved dragon and a bestial basilisk. As if these mythic dragons were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Dragons also equips your mythic dragons with an array of mythic feats with which to supercharge their already formidable abilities to bite, breathe, crush, and devour all who dare to stand against them. The 13 dragons contained herein, ranging in CR from 2 to 27, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these terrible lizards has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic green dragon's bilious spew and chlorinous miasma to the onrushing avalanche and glacial palisade of a mythic white dragon!</i><br><br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they\u2019ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and \u201cWhat was THAT?\u201d will warm any GM\u2019s heart.<br><br>This supplement is a terrific complement to the Mythic Monster Manual, with over 220 mythic monsters and an awesome array of monster-focused abilities, feats, and more for your Pathfinder game!

The product is rounded out by some special members of the extended dragon family, including ranging from the colossal pyroclastic terror that is the tor linnorm to the tiny but studious pseudodragon, friend to mages and loremasters everywhere, and the half-breed dracolisk, spawned from the unholy union of a depraved dragon and a bestial basilisk. As if these mythic dragons were not enough, Mythic Monsters: Dragons also equips your mythic dragons with an array of mythic feats with which to supercharge their already formidable abilities to bite, breathe, crush, and devour all who dare to stand against them. The 13 dragons contained herein, ranging in CR from 2 to 27, are updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every one of these terrible lizards has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from a mythic green dragon's bilious spew and chlorinous miasma to the onrushing avalanche and glacial palisade of a mythic white dragon!</i><br><br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they\u2019ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and \u201cWhat was THAT?\u201d will warm any GM\u2019s heart.<br><br>This supplement is a terrific complement to the Mythic Monster Manual, with over 220 mythic monsters and an awesome array of monster-focused abilities, feats, and more for your Pathfinder game! Pick up both books today and Make Your Game Legendary!<br><br><i>Conversion by:</i> <strong>Tony Lindberg</strong><br><br>Released on November 14, 2017.

Not everything will work. Trying to sell high-fashion, high-priced items in the poor part of town will not generate endless queues at your register. Will you try to dominate a competitive market, or go in an unexplored direction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Control the article flow</h2>For an article to be taken home by a customer, a lot of things must be taken care of. First you must select and order the articles. For a delivery to take place, the storage space must be able to receive and handle the delivered articles. The sales area must have the right displays and registers to showcase and sell the articles. Building a good relationship with your suppliers is key to be able to sell their more exclusive items. Oh, and by the way, which article should be the first for your customers to see when they enter your store? The bulk selling jeans, or the hyped silk shirt?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get people inside your store</h2>Build your reputation among your customers, and make your store the most sought after in town. A good marketing scheme, along with happy customers will work wonders for your income. But don't oversell your idea. If you can't keep what you promise, the customers will leave the store dissatisfied, and nothing ruins a store quicker than unhappy customers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Please the customer</h2>Create an enjoyable atmosphere for your customers to shop in, and theme your store, so they will know it is YOUR store they have entered. Make sure they receive the help they need, and that the lines for the registers don't grow too long. Manage the in-store marketing, so that both the fashionistas and the discount-hunters knows where to go, and which article to pick.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage your personnel</h2>When you have too much on your plate to handle yourself, it might be the time for you to get some staff. Find interesting candidates among the applications. Conduct interviews, get a feel for the person, and decide if they match the role you need taken care of. Negotiate their salary and hire them. Keep them happy, and make sure they are not overworked. A great working climate gives great dedication. But you still need to sort the slackers from the workers. Invest time in the right persons, and train them to become better so when you need a stand-in for yourself, when you move to the next store, you can pick from your own home-grown talents.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Optimize the store</h2>The difference between a good store and a great store lies in the detail. Weed out the poor selling articles, and get more of the good ones. Make sure you don't order unnecessarily many articles, but still enough that you don't run out. Optimize the prizes to increase the income. Find the customer patterns and adjust the opening hours accordingly. Plan an efficient staff schedule, so you don't pay people for doing nothing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Prepare for big events</h2>Is a VIP coming? Christmas soon? Black Friday? Can you spot the next big trend before anyone else? Adjust your actions according to the events occurring in a dynamic city that changes day by day. <br><br>All of this is is just an ordinary day as a store owner.<br><br>Are you ready to take on the challenge?

Hi, that's me!<br><br>Feedback is not only appreciated, but encouraged. This is not a &quot;complete and done game&quot;.

            "detailed_description": "Based on an award-winning Italian pen and paper RPG, Sine Requie: Snake Eyes is a Horror-Thriller roleplaying game with survival elements. <br>It revolves around the investigations of Inquisitor Rossano Mazzoni and its hunt against a secretive heretic cult in a post-apocalyptic 1954 Tuscany, in which the Dead rose to feed on the living.<br>Will you annihilate the new heretic cult: the Snake Eyes?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The story</h2>On the 6th of June 1944, in the day that everyone knows as the D-Day, the world felt into the darkness of hell. On Judgement Day the Dead begun their hunt against mankind. <br><br>It is the year 1954, the world has become a pile of crumbles, where the few survivors try resist the hunger of the Dead. Few nations, held by cruel dictatorships, are left intact. <br><br>The darkest future that mankind could imagine turned into the most monstrous reality. This is the world of Sine Requie. <br>What was once a country named Italy, today is the Sanctum Imperium, a firm theocracy ruled by Pope Leo XIV. <br><br>The Roman Church took absolute power, turning these lands into an anachronistic place, where armoured Templars and horse-mounted Inquisitors parade the streets side-by-side with cars. <br><br>Here the population lives left behind, immersed in obscurantism, hidden within the walls of their fortified towns. In the hope of surviving the grasp of the Dead, societies manically persecute the heretics, who are considered the emissaries of the Devil, sent among us to defeat the Justs in the day of the Apocalypse.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A story full of plot twists<br>Lead an inquisitorial team in their hunt against an heretical cult, racing against the clock. Your choices will change the story and the lives of those you will meet.  <br>Each chapter boasts more than seven different endings: how will you use the power you hold? Will you be able to stop the mysterious demonic ritual threatening the Imperium's order?

The player does not die after several hits, but the temporary invulnerability to enemy fire is not provided as well. Therefore, having missed a strong volley, you can almost immediately lose all your energy. The player has at his disposal several different types of weapons (laser, missiles). Using them you can effectively deal with enemies and bosses. For the sake of convenience, the main weapon shoots in auto mode.

Is it really the first contact at last and the humankind is no longer alone in the Universe?

Stranded in the middle of an ocean, in front of a gigantic tower, the hero has to find out what the place is, what happened there, and most importantly, who he is.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629690/extras/GolemPull_24fps.jpg?t=1532971344\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629690/extras/key_features.png?t=1532971344\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>First person real-time combat<br></li><li>Puzzles and level-wide objectives<br></li><li>Gadget-based RPG system<br></li><li>Lots of exploration, loot, and character customization<br></li><li>Mysterious storyline filled with secrets<br></li><li>Fully voiced main characters<br></li><li>Immersive steampunk setting</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629690/extras/combat.png?t=1532971344\" ><br><br>Combat takes place in real time.
